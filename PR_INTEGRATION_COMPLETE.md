- Foreign key constraints and indexes for performance
- Timestamp tracking for all entities

### API Design

- RESTful API endpoints following existing patterns
- Proper error handling and response formatting
- Authentication and authorization middleware
- Rate limiting and security measures

### Frontend Architecture

- React components with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Axios for API communication
- Responsive design patterns
- State management with hooks

### Security Features

- Webhook signature verification using HMAC-SHA256
- User authentication and authorization
- Repository access control
- Input validation and sanitization

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

```env
# Add to your .env file
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
```

### 2. Database Setup

The PR tables will be automatically created when you run:

```bash
npm run init-db
```

### 3. GitHub Webhook Configuration

1. Go to repository settings → Webhooks
2. Add webhook with URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/github`
3. Select "Pull requests" and "Issue comments" events
4. Set the secret to match your environment variable

### 4. Start the Application

```bash
# Backend
npm run dev

# Frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🚀 Usage

### For Users

1. **Sign in** with GitHub OAuth
2. **Sync repositories** from the dashboard
3. **View PRs** via "Pull Requests" in the navigation
4. **Search and filter** PRs using the built-in tools
5. **Manual sync** if webhooks aren't configured

### For Developers

- All PR data is automatically synced via webhooks
- Manual sync available via API endpoints
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Webhook event tracking and reprocessing

## 📊 Features Overview

### Automatic Detection

- ✅ Webhooks automatically detect PR creation, updates, and closures
- ✅ Real-time processing of GitHub events
- ✅ Secure signature verification

### Manual Sync

- ✅ Sync all PRs for a repository
- ✅ Sync individual PRs by number
- ✅ Background processing with status tracking

### Data Display

- ✅ Comprehensive PR information (title, body, author, branches, etc.)
- ✅ File changes with additions/deletions
- ✅ Comments and reviews
- ✅ Statistics and metrics

### Search & Filtering

- ✅ Full-text search across PR titles and descriptions
- ✅ Filter by state (open, closed, merged)
- ✅ Filter by author
- ✅ Filter by label
- ✅ Pagination and sorting

## 🔍 API Examples

### Get PRs for Repository

```bash
GET /api/repositories/123/pull-requests?state=open&limit=20
```

### Search PRs

```bash
GET /api/repositories/123/pull-requests/search?q=bug&author=john&state=open
```

### Sync PRs

```bash
POST /api/repositories/123/pull-requests/sync
```

### Get PR Statistics

```bash
GET /api/repositories/123/pull-requests/stats
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Webhooks Not Working

- Check webhook URL is accessible
- Verify webhook secret matches environment variable
- Check webhook events are properly configured
- Review webhook event logs in the database

### PRs Not Syncing

- Ensure GitHub token has proper permissions
- Check repository access permissions
- Verify network connectivity to GitHub API
- Check application logs for errors

### Database Issues

- Run `npm run init-db` to create missing tables
- Check database connection configuration
- Verify MySQL is running and accessible

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: GitHub API rate limits are respected
- **Pagination**: PR lists are paginated for large repositories
- **Async Processing**: Webhook processing is asynchronous
- **Caching**: PR data is cached in the database
- **Indexing**: Database indexes for fast queries

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Real-time WebSocket notifications for live updates
- PR diff visualization
- Integration with code review workflows
- Automated PR analysis and suggestions
- Team collaboration features
- PR templates and automation
